    <h1>LOOPS</h1>
    <p>Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is true.</p>
    <div class="grant1">
        <ul>
            <li><p><b>For:</b>loops through a block of code a specified number of times</p></li>
            <li><p><b>ForEach:</b>loops through a block of code for each element in an array</p></li>
            <li><p><b>While:</b>loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Do-While:</b> loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true</p></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>FOR LOOP</h2>
     <p>The for statement is used when you know how many times you want to execute a statement or a block of statements.</p>
     <h3>SYNTAX:</h3>
     <div class="grant">
     <pre>
        for (initialization; condition; increment){
            code to be executed;
         }
     </pre>
    </div>
     <h3>EXAMPLE:</h3>
     <div class="grant1">
         <pre>
            &lt?php
            $a = 0;
            $b = 0;
            for( $i = 0; $i<5; $i++ ) {
               $a += 10;
               $b += 5;
            }
            echo ("At the end of the loop a = $a and b = $b" );
         ?>
         </pre>
     </div>
     <h2>FOREACH LOOP</h2>
     <p>The foreach statement is used to loop through arrays.</p>
      <p> For each pass the value of the current array element is assigned to $value and the array pointer is moved by one and in the next pass next element will be processed.</p>
     <h3>SYNTAX:</h3>
     <div class="grant">
     <pre>
        foreach (array as value) {
            code to be executed;
         }
     </pre>
    </div>
     <h3>EXAMPLE:</h3>
     <div class="grant1">
         <pre>
            &lt?php
            $array = array( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

            foreach( $array as $value ) {
               echo "Value is $value \n";
            }
         ?>
         </pre>
     </div>
     <h2>WHILE LOOP</h2>
     <ul>
        <li><p>The while statement will execute a block of code if and as long as a test expression is true.</p></li>
        <li><p>If the test expression is true then the code block will be executed. </p></li>
        <li><p>After the code has executed the test expression will again be evaluated and the loop will continue until the test expression is found to be false.</p></li>
     </ul>
     <h3>SYNTAX:</h3>
     <div class="grant">
     <pre>
        while (condition) {
            code to be executed;
         }
     </pre>
    </div>
     <h3>EXAMPLE:</h3>
     <div class="grant1">
         <pre>
            &lt?php
            $i = 0;
            $num = 50;
            while($i &lt 10) {
               $num--;
               $i++;
            }
            echo ("Loop stopped at i = $i and num = $num" );
         ?>
         </pre>
     </div>
     <h2>DO-WHILE LOOP</h2>
     <p>The do-while statement will execute a block of code at least once - it then will repeat the loop as long as a condition is true.</p>
     <h3>SYNTAX:</h3>
     <div class="grant">
     <pre>
        do {
            code to be executed;
         }
         while (condition);
     </pre>
    </div>
     <h3>EXAMPLE:</h3>
     <div class="grant1">
         <pre>
            &lt?php
            $i = 0;
            $num = 0;
            do {
               $i++;
            }
            while( $i &lt 10 );
            echo ("Loop stopped at i = $i" );
         ?>
