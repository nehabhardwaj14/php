            The term PHP is an acronym for – Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. 
            It is an open-source which means it is free to download and use. It is very simple to learn and use. The file extension of PHP is “.php”.

            PHP is a server-side scripting language created primarily for web development but it is also used as a general-purpose programming language.
             Unlike client-side languages like JavaScript, which are executed on the user’s browser, PHP scripts run on the server.
              The results are then sent to the client’s web browser as plain HTML.

        PHP was introduced by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the first version and participated in the later versions. It is an interpreted language and it does not require a compiler. 
        The language quickly evolved and was given the name “PHP,” which initially named was “Personal Home Page.”

        <ul>
            <li><p>PHP 3 (1998): The first version considered suitable for widespread use.</p></li>
            <li><p>PHP 4 (2000): Improved performance and the introduction of the Zend Engine.</p></li> 
            <li><p> PHP 5 (2004): Added object-oriented programming features.</p></li>
            <li><p> PHP 7 (2015): Significant performance improvements and reduced memory usage.</p></li>
            <li><p>PHP 8 (2020): Introduction of Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, further enhancing performance.</p></li>

    <h2>Characteristics of PHP</h2>
    <div class="intro">
        <ul>
            <li><p>PHP code is executed in the server.</p></li>
            <li><p>It can be integrated with many databases such as Oracle,
                 Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase, and Informix.</p></li>
            <li><p>It is powerful to hold a content management system like WordPress and can be used to control user access.</p></li>
            <li><p>It supports main protocols like HTTP Basic, HTTP Digest, IMAP, FTP, and others.</p></li>
            <li><p>Websites like www.facebook.com and www.yahoo.com are also built on PHP.</p></li>
            <li><p>One of the main reasons behind this is that PHP can be easily embedded in HTML files and HTML codes can also be written in a PHP file.</p></li>
            <li><p>The thing that differentiates PHP from the client-side language like HTML is, that PHP codes are executed on the server whereas HTML codes are directly rendered on the browser. PHP codes are first executed on the server and then the result is returned to the browser.</p></li>
